    "abstract": "\"Longtermism\" is the view that the impacts of our actions on the very long-term future deserve prominent consideration in decision-making. We discuss the primary barrier that prevents academic economists from contributing to longtermist research: an overly rigid preference for methodological \"hardness\" (Akerlof, 2020). Hardness bias prevents economists from engaging in methodologically pluralistic, interdisciplinary, qualitative, and other kinds of research, including most potential longtermist research. We unpack hardness bias, discuss its roots, illustrate how it prevents economists from engaging in longtermist research, and try to present a positive vision of the kinds of longtermist research economists could engage in if hardness norms were relaxed.",

    "abstract": "How does codetermination—entitling workers to participate in firm governance, either through membership on company boards or the formation of works councils—affect worker welfare and corporate decision making? We critically discuss the history and contemporary operation of European codetermination arrangements and review empirical evidence on their effects on firms and workers. Our review suggests that these arrangements are unlikely to significantly shift power in the workplace, but may mildly improve worker welfare and firm performance, in part by boosting information-sharing and cooperation and in part by slightly increasing worker influence.",

    "abstract": "The Benacerraf-Field Problem is the challenge, for mathematical realists, of explaining why our mathematical beliefs are reliable, given that we can't interact with or observe mathematical entities. On one interpretation, the Benacerraf-Field Problem threatens the counterfactual sensitivity of our mathematical beliefs: the Problem suggests that, if the mathematical facts were different, our mathematical beliefs would not be correspondingly different. I argue that, on this interpretation, the Benacerraf-Field Problem can be overcome. If the mathematical facts were different, the physical world would have to be correspondingly different. For example, if the solution to a set of differential equations predicts the equilibrium behaviour of a physical system, then if the solution to those equations were different, the equilibrium behaviour of that system would have to be correspondingly different. Moreover, our mathematical beliefs are informed by the physical world, since our mathematical beliefs are influenced by our physical intuitions and because mathematics often develops in tandem with science. So if the mathematical facts were different, the physical world would have to be correspondingly different; and if the physical world were different, our mathematical beliefs would be correspondingly different. It follows that our mathematical beliefs are counterfactually sensitive, and the Benacerraf-Field Problem can be overcome."
