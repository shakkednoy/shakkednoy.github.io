Hi, I'm Shakked! I'm currently a first-year PhD student in the Economics Department at MIT, interested in labor economics, behavioral economics, and political economy.

I'm originally from New Zealand, where I studied economics, math, and philosophy at Victoria University of Wellington. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a predoctoral research assistant at Motu Economic & Public Policy Research and at MIT.

On this website, you can find my [research](http://shakkednoy.com/research/) and my [CV](http://shakkednoy.com/cv.pdf).
